* = archers/ throwers, they are implemented but have the disability to attack other mobs, therefore...
(for good mobs); serve as deco
(for evil mobs); serve as a player attacker but not other npc attacker. Fine.
Stuff that are cancel (like this) = stuff that need new models
# = empty hand, need new model

Skins: (Just a basic face and clothes; armor and such will be added using textures from the armors)
